# Deep Convolutional GAN for the MNIST Dataset

This repository shows the results of a simple DCGAN for the MNIST dataset. The training can be started via the [train_dcgan.py](train_dcgan.py) file. An interactive output of the training script is shown in [train_dcgan.ipynb](train_dcgan.ipynb).

Generated images from DCGAN:

Generated images from DCGAN during training epochs:

During or after training it is possible to supervise the training and the stability of the GAN in TensorBoard. TensorBoard should be already installed on your machine, if you installed tensorflow via pip/conda etc. To start TensorBoard type this command from in your terminal after you changed the working directory to the folder, where the training-logs are located:
```
tensorboard --logdir logs
```
When this command is executed successfully, you can run TensorBoard from your Browser. (typically at [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/)) 

Supervise training-losses:

Supervise generated images for each epoch:

![tensorboard_1](images/tensorboard_2.png)

In addition to the log-files for TensorBoard a **png-file** of the generated images in the final epoch and an animated **gif-file** of the generated images in each epoch is saved in the image folder of the log-directory after the completion of the final epoch.
